Welcome to the Falcon 9 1st-Stage Landing Prediction Project! This project aims to predict the success or failure of Falcon 9 first stage landings using Machine Learning techniques. By leveraging data collected from the SpaceX public API and Wikipedia, I've developed predictive models to anticipate landing outcomes accurately.




## Project Overview

**Data Collection and Cleaning:** We gathered data from the SpaceX public API and Wikipedia, meticulously cleaning it to ensure accuracy. This involved refining launch sites, orbit types, and mission outcomes.

**Outcome Classification:** Implemented a binary classification system to categorize mission outcomes. A value of 1 indicates a successful Falcon 9 first stage landing, while 0 denotes failure. This classification was integrated into the dataset for further analysis.

**Predictive Analysis:** Utilized Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN Machine Learning models to analyze the cleaned and classified launch data. These models enable us to forecast landing outcomes accurately, providing valuable insights for SpaceX missions.
